  Author: Joshua Dunfield, Jacob Thomas Errington
  Contents: Debug-print library with up to 31 separate categories of information.

  Usage:

   - show, showAll, showNone determine which categories will be printed.

   - In each client module, create debug-printer functions by calling `makeFunctions':

      let (dprint, dprnt) = Debug.makeFunctions (Debug.toFlags [...])

    where `...' is the category (conceivably, categories) specific to the module.

   - `print' takes a thunk; `prnt' (misspelled) takes a string;
     `printf' takes a callback receiving formatter, with which you can
     generate formatted output, including custom indentation.

   If debugging is turned off, `print' is more efficient whenever
   computing the string is at all nontrivial.
   This actually matters; running the test suite with debug mode
   enabled takes several times longer.

   All functions will add a newline after printing your text.

val enable : unit -> unit
val init : string option -> unit

val makeFunctions : flags
                    -> ((unit -> string) -> unit) * (string -> unit)

(** This submodule defines a record containing a higher-rank
    polymorhic function. We need this record type so that we can pass
    a partially-applied Format.fprintf function to client modules.
    We introduce the submodule so that client modules can selectively
    open it if they want to use the format-string support provided by
    Debug; this will bring into scope only the `fmt` type and the
    `fmt` projection for the record.

    Clients can then write:
    let dprintf, _, _ = Debug.makeFunctions (Debug.toFlags [11])
    open Debug.Fmt
    let _ =
      dprintf (fun p -> p.fmt "%s %d" "hello" 4)
 *)
module Fmt : sig
  type fmt =
    { fmt : 'a. ('a, Format.formatter, unit) format -> 'a }
end

type 'a io = 'a -> unit
val makeFunctions' : flags
                     -> Fmt.fmt io io
                        * (unit -> string) io
                        * string io

val toFlags : int list -> flags

(** Tests if a given flag is set. *)
val flag : int -> bool

(** Runs the given function with debug printing indented by the given
    number of spaces.
    Pass in dprintf obtained by calling makeFunctions'.
    Note that the vbox introduced to indent will NOT be closed if the
    given function raises an exception. This is a trade-off since the
    alternative would be to reraise the exception, which sadly
    destroys the backtrace.
