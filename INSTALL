1. Installation
=========================

1.1 Generic Prerequisites
=========================

The following packages must be installed to use Beluga:

ocaml 3.12.2+:           http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
extlib:                  http://code.google.com/p/ocaml-extlib/downloads/list
ulex:                    http://www.cduce.org/download.html#side

Users not running Windows may wish to build using omake:

omake:			 http://omake.metaprl.org/index.html

Optional dependencies (for improved interactive mode):

rlwrap:                  http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/uck/rlwrap/


1.1.1 Debian/Ubuntu
-------------------

Under Debian Linux, all the necessary prerequisites can be installed
with just the following command:

# apt-get install ocaml ocaml-findlib libextlib-ocaml-dev ocaml-ulex

The interactive mode is greatly improved if you have rlwrap installed,
so you might also want to consider:

# apt-get install rlwrap

These commands may work under other distributions.

1.1.2 Windows
-------------

Beluga can be executed on Windows through Cygwin. The necessary prerequisites can be installed
using an OCalm package manager called WODI. 

1. Download WODI's graphical installer wodi32/64.exe
http://wodi.forge.ocamlcore.org/download.html

2. Run wodi32/64.exe and step through the installation wizard
Note: if you don't already have Cygwin installed, it will be installed for you. The installation directory you select will be the root directory within the WODI Cygwin terminal.

3. From the start menu, select Wodi32/64 Package Manager. Don't be alarmed if WODI cannot read all PATH entries.

4. Search for each of the prerequisite packages: extlib, ulex, ounit, findlib. Check the box beside each of the packages and click "Apply". The checkbox will be greyed out if the package has already been installed.

1.2 Building
============

Compile by running "make" from the Beluga directory.

./beluga
# make

You can now run Beluga programs with the newly 
"beluga" executable in the "bin" directory

./beluga
# ./bin/beluga path/to/program.bel

1.2.1 Compilation options
-------------------------

Setting the following environment variables for "make" enables the
following compilation option:

BYTE:          sets byte-code compilation instead of native
DEBUG:         enables the -g option of ocamlc
PROFILE:       enables the -p option of ocamlc
WARN_PATTERN:  enables warning for non-exhaustive patterns
VERBOSE:       sets verbosity level of ocamlbuild
PARALLEL:      sets max number of parallel processes

For instance, to enable byte-code compilation, run:

make BYTE=true

Running `make clean' will clean the directory of compilation results

1.3 Troubleshooting
===================

Attempting to build Beluga before installing the prequisites may cause
libraries to be only partially updated. You may recieve a new error message
once you've set up the prereq packages.

Error: The files [path/to/file]
        and [path/to/file]
        make inconsistent assumptions over interface [library name]

Try cleaning the Beluga directory.

./beluga
# ./make clean all

=========================
2. Configuration
=========================

2.1 Running Ruby script to convert to new syntax
================================================

You will need Ruby 1.9 for running the script.

For MAC OS:
The default version of ruby installed on Mac OS is usually not Ruby 1.9, but
Ruby 1.8. To install the newest version of Ruby, we recommend installing first
RVM, the â€œRuby Version Manager. This will make installing Ruby 1.9 easy. In your
home directory, you can say:

 bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)

rvm is then installed in .rvm/bin.

Then you can say:

.rvm/bin/rvm install 1.9.3

Note, you will want to add .rvm/bin to your .bashrc directory, so you will be able to
find rvm without giving the full path.

2.2 Beluga-mode for GNU Emacs
=============================

Beluga includes a major mode for programming in Emacs. The elisp file is locationed in the
./beluga/tools directory. To configure Beluga-mode:

1. Update your ~/.emacs configuration file with the lines written below. XEmacs users must 
update ~/.xemacs and ~/.xema.cs/init.el with the same text. Create any of these files if 
they do not exist already.

(add-to-list 'load-path "/home/bpientka/complogic/beluga/tools/")
(load "beluga-mode.el")

NOTE: Feel free to move ther beluga-mode.el file to another directory so long as you 
ensure its location is included in the Emacs load-path.

2. Restart Emacs.
 .
Emacs will now launch in Beluga-mode automatically when you open a Beluga program.
