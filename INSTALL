This document describes the compilation and installation procedures
for Beluga.

*      [Prerequisites]
       *        [GODI]
       *        [GODI Installation Instructions]

*      [Building]


Prerequisites
=============

Debian
------

Under Debian Linux, all the necessary prerequisites can be installed
with just the following command:

# apt-get install ocaml omake ocaml-findlib libextlib-ocaml-dev libounit-ocaml-dev ocaml-ulex

The same might hold for other distributions.


Generic
-------

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Before downloading and installing any of these, or
 giving up in despair, see the following section about the OCaml GODI
 distribution.*

ocaml 3.10 or greater:  http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
extlib:                 http://code.google.com/p/ocaml-extlib/downloads/list
ulex:                   http://www.cduce.org/download.html#side
omake:                  http://omake.metaprl.org/index.html
ounit:                  http://ounit.forge.ocamlcore.org/

GODI
----

The above list of required packages may seem excessive and you may
feel that you shouldn't have to manually download and install five or
more separate packages to compile this software. 

That's why, rather than downloading the extremely barebones OCaml
compiler, you can instead download the OCaml GODI] distribution
and have it download and install the necessary packages for you.

GODI Installation Instructions
------------------------------

1. Download the most recent GODI tarball, e.g.,
   `godi-rocketboost-20080630.tar.gz`

2. Extract the GODI tarball to somewhere convenient, e.g.,
   `/tmp/godi-rocketboost-20080630`

3. `cd /tmp/godi-rocketboost-20080630` or wherever you extracted to.

4. Run the first bootstrap script, placing the GODI installation
   somewhere convenient, e.g.,

       $ ./bootstrap -prefix ~/local/GODI

5. After the bootstrap completes, make sure to add the GODI bin and
   man directories to your $PATH and $MANPATH variables respectively,
   e.g.,

       # GODI
       export PATH=~/local/GODI/bin:~/local/GODI/sbin:$PATH
       export MANPATH=~/local/GODI/man:$MANPATH

6. Either restart your terminal, or refresh your shell configuration,

       $ source ~/.profile

   if you use `~/.profile` to set your environment variables.

7. Still within `/tmp/godi-rocketboost-20080630`, run

       $ ./bootstrap_stage2

   During this phase, your GODI installation will synchronize with the
   central GODI repository and obtain the necessary information to
   download and build the packages.

   *NOTE: If this stage fails, it may give you a message about PCRE
   not being found.  If this is the case, edit and uncomment the line:
   `GODI_BASEPKG_PCRE=yes` in `~/local/GODI/etc/godi.conf`, then rerun
   `./bootstrap_stage2`.*

   This phase will take a little while since it will download,
   compile, and install the basic ocaml compiler and several other
   fundamental packages.  Once the second bootstrap phase has
   completed, you have a basic GODI installation.

8. Now we will install the Beluga dependencies mentioned above:

       $ godi_wish -build godi-extlib -build godi-ulex -build godi-omake -build godi-ounit

       $ godi_perform -wishes

   You should now see GODI begin to build and install the packages.
   Once this stage finishes, you are ready to follow the build
   instructions below for Beluga itself.


Building
========

Install the dependencies and then run "omake", after which you'll have an
"interpreter" executable in the "bin" directory.


Native code compilation
========================

If Beluga seems too slow, try using the OCaml native code compiler:

  omake NATIVE_ENABLED=true 

This typically results in about a 6x speedup.  Note, however, that if you
ever need to run `omake clean', you should pass the same option:

  omake NATIVE_ENABLED=true clean

Running `omake clean' without setting NATIVE_ENABLED may not properly
remove the native code.


Running Ruby script to convert to new syntax
=============================================

You will need Ruby 1.9 for running the script.

For MAC OS:
The default version of ruby installed on Mac OS is usually not Ruby 1.9, but
Ruby 1.8. To install the newest version of Ruby, we recommend installing first
RVM, the “Ruby Version Manager. This will make installing Ruby 1.9 easy. In your
home directory, you can say:

 bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)

rvm is then installed in .rvm/bin. 

Then you can say: 

.rvm/bin/rvm install 1.9.3

Note, you will want to add .rvm/bin to your .bashrc directory, so you will be able to
find rvm without giving the full path.
