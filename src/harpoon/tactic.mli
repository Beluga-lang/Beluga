val invoke : Comp.exp_syn -> Comp.typ -> Id.name -> t

(** Solves the current goal with an implication whose conclusion is
   compatible with the goal type. Subgoals are generated for each
   premise of the implication.

    The user needs to decide upfront what the types of all the
   premises are, and these given types must unify with the
   corresponding premise types. Furthermore, this unification must pin
   down all universally quantified variables, as there is no way to
   construct them using Harpoon. (Harpoon can only construct
   computational objects, not LF objects.)

    Another restriction is that *all* universally quantified variables
   must appear at the beginning. That is, the type `tau` must be of
   the form

    tau = Pi X_1:U_1. ... Pi X_n:U_n. tau_1 -> ... -> tau_k -> tau'

    (This is most common form of type for a Beluga function.)

    Subject to the following requirements:
    - cD; cG |- i ==> tau
    - tau' unifies with the current goal type.
    - each tau_i unifies with the corresponding type in the args list.

    After all these unifications, there must be no remaining
    universally quantified variables. (Such a type would be very
    strange, so this requirement is quite weak.)

    The concrete syntax of this command piggybacks off the syntax of
    `by` is

    by <lemma/ih> i suffices tau_1, ..., tau_k
