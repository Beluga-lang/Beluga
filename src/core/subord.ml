   Printing the subordination relation.
   Computing the relation is done in store.ml, as constructors are added.
   Also has `thin', which uses subordination to generate a substitution that
    doesn't use irrelevant parts of a context.

 * OVERVIEW
 *
 * The type B is subordinate to the type A if a term of type A can appear in a term of type B.
 * Subordination is entirely a data-level (LF) notion; it can be determined from the
 * LF signature alone.
 *
 * The usual reference for subordination is Roberto Virga's 1999 thesis.  However, Virga
 *  does not call it subordination; rather, he uses a "dependence relation" (pp. 55-59),
 *  also called "containment".
 *
 * The following statements are equivalent:
 *    "h-terms can contain g-terms"
 *    "h is subordinate to g"
 *    "g subordinates h"
 *
 * In addition, we define---separately from the "h-terms can contain g-terms"
 * relation---a _type subordination_ relation that says whether a type can contain
 * terms of another type.  For example, in the usual dependent indexing of lists by
 * their length, we have
 *
 *     list : nat -> type.
 *
 * Therefore "list-terms can contain nat-terms", or equivalently,
 *
 *   "list is type-subordinate to nat"
 *   "nat type-subordinates list"
 *
 * Note that while term-level subordination is transitive---if terms of type k can
 * include terms of type h, and terms of type h can include terms of type g, then
 * terms of type k can include terms of type g---type-level subordination is *not*
 * a transitive relation.
 *
 *     list : nat -> type.
 *     t : list (suc (suc z)) -> type.
 *
 * t is type-subordinate to list, and list is type-subordinate to nat, but t is *not*
 * type-subordinate to nat, because the dependent type arguments to t does not
 * include nat-terms.
 *
 * -jd 2010-06
 * [BP : NOTE 5 Apr, 2011 ]
 *     list : nat -> type.
 *     t : list (suc (suc N)) -> type.
 *
 * t is type-subordinate to list, and list is type-subordinate to nat; t *must*
 * be type-subordinate to nat, because the dependent type arguments to t does
 * include nat-terms.

(*  relevant tA basis = rlist

    For every type family occurring in tA,
    check if it is a subordinate of a type in basis
          or it is equal to a type in basis;

    Idea : Can tA be used to construct elements in basis ?
      if there is a type family a in tA s.t. a is a
      subordinate of a type in basis or a itself is equal to
      a type in basis,  then we will keep a.

      Elements of the type family a can be used to construct
      elements in basis
