Since Beluga does not support equality types, we implement equality using an LF type family as a dependent kind. The difficulties of defining equality via reflexivity in Twelf do not arise in Beluga. Beluga's proof is implemented as a function using pattern matching instead of relations; as we pattern match we learn more about the given derivations and information flows as expected.
