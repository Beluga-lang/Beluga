## [Beluga](http://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca/beluga/ "Beluga home page")  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Beluga-lang/Beluga.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Beluga-lang/Beluga)

[Beluga](http://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca/beluga/ "Beluga home page") is a functional programming language designed for reasoning
about formal systems. It features direct support for object-level
binding constructs using higher order abstract syntax and treats
contexts as first class objects.

This branch (annotations) aims to add better type annotations to the emacs interactive mode via pairing nodes in the external syntax tree (providing locations), with nodes in the internal syntax tree (providing types), including the return of expression highlighting.
