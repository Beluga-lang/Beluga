Administrative commands
-----------------------

Administrative commands are used to navigate the proof, obtain information about
functions or constructors, or to prove a lemma in the middle of another proof.

.. _cmd-theorem:

``theorem``
^^^^^^^^^^^

Use ``theorem COMMAND`` for operations relating to a particular theorem.

``theorem list``
""""""""""""""""

Displays a listing of all theorems in the current session.

``theorem defer``
"""""""""""""""""

Moves the current theorem to the bottom of the theorem stack, selecting the next
theorem.

See :ref:`cmd-select` for a more flexible way to select a theorem.

``theorem show-ihs``
""""""""""""""""""""

Display the induction hypotheses available in the current subgoal.

``theorem dump-proof PATH``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Records the current theorem's partial proof to ``PATH``.

``theorem show-proof``
""""""""""""""""""""""

Displays the current theorem's partial proof.

.. _cmd-session:

``session``
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _cmd-session-list:

``session list``
""""""""""""""""

Lists all active sessions together with all theorems within each session.

``session defer``
"""""""""""""""""

Moves the current session to the bottom of the session stack and selects the
next one.

See :ref:`cmd-select` for a more flexible way to select a theorem.

``session create``
""""""""""""""""""

Creates a new session. This command will start the :ref:`session configuration
wizard` for setting up the theorems in the new session.

``session serialize``
"""""""""""""""""""""

.. _cmd-subgoal:

``subgoal``
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _cmd-select:

``select``
^^^^^^^^^^

``select NAME`` selects a theorem by name for proving.
See the :ref:`session list <cmd-session-list>` command.

.. _cmd-rename:

``rename``
^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    Renaming is poorly supported at the moment.

    The resulting Harpoon proof script that is generated by interactive proving
    will not contain the renaming, and this could lead to accidental variable
    capture.

Renames a variable. Use ``rename meta SRC DST`` to rename a metavariable and
``rename comp SRC DST`` to rename a program variable.

.. _cmd-toggle-automation:

``toggle-automation``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _cmd-type:

``type``
^^^^^^^^

.. _cmd-info:

``info``
^^^^^^^^

Proof tactics
-------------

.. _cmd-intros:

``intros``
^^^^^^^^^^

.. _cmd-split:

``split``
^^^^^^^^^

.. _cmd-msplit:

``msplit``
^^^^^^^^^^

.. _cmd-by:

``by``
^^^^^^

.. _cmd-solve:

``solve``
^^^^^^^^^

.. _cmd-suffices:

``suffices``
^^^^^^^^^^^^
