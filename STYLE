This document describes several stylistic conventions used within the
Beluga source code and its accompanying documentation.

Documentation <a id="01"/>
=============

Character Set <a id="02"/>
-------------

The Beluga source code and documentation are encoded with UTF-8.  Any
files added to the source tree should be saved with the appropriate
encoding.  To help maintain this invariant, the emacs mode line
present at the top of this file should be placed within all new files
immediately upon creation.

Markup <a id="03"/>
------

Simple textual documentation files, such as this one, use a
lightweight markup language known as [Markdown][01].  They are
readable as regular text files with the added benefit of being
renderable to HTML, LaTeX, or a variety of other formats in a nice and
consistent fashion.  A Markdown mode for Emacs is available
[here][02].

Coding <a id="04"/>
======


Philosophy <a id="05"/>
----------

The Beluga source code is intended, above all, to be *correct* and *clear*.


Documentation <a id="06"/>
-------------

The Beluga source code is intended to be fully documented.  We use
[ocamldoc][03] for documentation markup and pretty documentation
generation.

All modules should have their signatures fully documented: exceptions,
functions, and types should include at least a brief comment.  Where
possible, syntactic conventions from publications should be correlated
with the source code in question.  For this, we will often use
Unicode.  For example, if something is called Ψ in a paper, then Ψ
should be written in the comment, rather than `Psi'.
