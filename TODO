CRITICAL
========

* 10/23/08 :: Several cases of variable shadowing, might want to
              consider during code-walk.  -dwm

* 10/12/08 :: Naming Scheme for Brigitte's code.  -dwm



IMPORTANT
=========

* 10/25/08 :: Make pretty printer break line late rather than early.
              -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: Fix pretty printing of internal syntax to show names
              rather than cids.  -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: SigmaDec and SigmaDecl are a bit close together...  -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: Should probably make clo type abbreviations actual
              datatypes with constructors.  Clearer this way, esp. since we are
              currying functions.  -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: Functions that just tuple back up all of their arguments
              should maybe use f = function.  -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: Some functions named with ' and 1.  What's the
              difference / significance?  -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: Many of the longer pattern cases could probably be
              greatly simplified using pattern guards.  Investigate.
              -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: Many invariants / comments written in different styles,
              making them harder to read.  Should revisit as group.
              -dwm

* 10/24/08 :: Add unify.mli.  -dwm

* 10/23/08 :: Investigate magic parens, i.e., Foo of (bar * baz)
              vs. Foo of bar * baz.  -dwm

* 10/22/08 :: Add target for debugging, add documentaiton on how to
              use.  -dwm

* 10/15/08 :: Cleanup Makefile.  -dwm

* 10/14/08 :: Consider a way to use labels to clean up pretty printer
              interface.  May be possible pass std_formatter and
              std_lvl in as default arguments.  -dwm



MINOR
=====

* 10/25/08 :: Could we call cD cDel to go better with cPsi?  -dwm

* 10/16/08 :: Add proper interface for token.ml.  Some tricky bits
              with the Camlp4 sig.  -dwm

* 10/15/08 :: Investigate gensym, think about wrap around.  -dwm

* 10/12/08 :: Fix documentation generation.  -dwm
