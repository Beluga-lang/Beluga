Encountered meta^2-variables and free variables,
which we cannot abstract over because they depend on meta-variables;
the user needs to supply more information,
since the type of a given expression is not uniquely determined.
Meta^2-variables are introduced during type reconstruction;
if you explicitely quantify over some meta-variables,
these meta-variables will impose constraints on meta^2-variables
and we may not be able to abstract over the meta^2-variables.
The solution is either to not specify any meta-variables explicitly,
or specify all of them.
