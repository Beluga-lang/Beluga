This directory contains the Elf implementation of cut elimination
for intuitionistic and classical first-order logic described
in the technical report

  Frank Pfenning.  A structural proof of cut elimination and its
  representation in a logical framework.  Technical Report CMU-CS-94-218,
  Department of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, November 1994.

ABSTRACT:

 We present new proofs of cut elimination for intuitionistic and classical
sequent calculi.  In both cases the proofs proceed by three nested structural
inductions, avoiding the explicit use of multi-sets and termination measures
on sequent derivations.  This makes them amenable to elegant and concise
representations in LF, which are given in full detail.
