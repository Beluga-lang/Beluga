term  : type.
true  : term.
false : term.
switch: term -> term -> term -> term.
z     : term.
succ  : term -> term.
pred  : term -> term.
iszero: term -> term.

leq   : term -> term -> term.


% Examples : Valid Terms

let v1 = [ |- switch false z (succ z)] ;
let v2 = [ |- iszero (pred (succ z))]  ;

% The following is still a valid term
% although we may want to identify it as
% ill-typed later. So far, we only are concerned
% with syntax.

let v3 = [ |- switch (succ z) (succ z) false]  ;
