- Build a bridge between Harpoon and msolve(logic.ml).
  Note: * Harpoon will have a meta-context cD and a computation-level type T (typically Box or Inductive) it tries to prove
        * msolve and sgnMQuery work on the computation-level type Pibox cD . T
	
  --> Revisit how we store computation-level goals in sgnMQuery
  --> Revisit how we kick-off msolve
  ---> Pesently we unroll the Pibox quantified variables from the mquery
      (i.e. computation-level type Pibox cD . T)  in unsolve to then call
      to obtain cD together with a computation-level type T (typically Box or Inductive)
 

- Introduce automated split in proof-loop
  --> add in another argument to mquery in which the user will specify the var. to split on
  --> generate induction hyp. if there is one (try to use the split tactic from Harpoon)


- Introduce a 'blurring' phase in the loop
  --> this will involve focusing on assumptions in which the heads don't unify with the goal
  --> once we have focused on the head of such an assumption, we add that atomic type to either cD or cG (depending on the type) and continue again with focusing
                              L
                 cD ; cG, R' ===> R
	      ----------------------- blur
		 cD ; cG > R' ===> R
