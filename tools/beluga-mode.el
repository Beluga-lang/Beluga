;; BUGS

;; - Indentation thinks "." can only be the termination marker of
;;   an LF declaration.  This can mess things up badly.
;; - Indentation after curried terms like "fn x => fn y =>" is twice that
;;   after "fn x y =>".

\(:next TOKEN . OFFSET-RULES)	if TOK is followed by TOKEN, use OFFSET-RULES.

`parent'				align with the parent.
NUMBER				offset by NUMBER.
\(+ OFFSETS...)			use the sum of OFFSETS.
VARIABLE			use the value of VARIABLE as offset.

The precise meaning of `point' depends on various details: it can
either mean the position of the token we're indenting, or the
position of its parent, or the position right after its parent.
