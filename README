Project Description
===================


  Our main interest in this project is to investigate programming 
and reasoning with data structures that provide support for binders. 
Many object languages include binding constructs, and it is striking 
that functional languages still lack direct support for binders and 
common tricky operations such as renaming, capture-avoiding substitution,
 and fresh name generation.

We advocate the use of higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) where we 
represent binders in the object language with binders in the meta-language. 
One of the key benefits is that we not only get support for renaming 
and fresh name generation, but also for capture-avoiding substitution. 
While HOAS encodings have played an important role in mechanizing the 
meta-theory of programming languages, it has been difficult to incorporate 
HOAS encodings directly into functional programming. 

The Beluga implementation provides an implementation of the logical
framework LF, and in addition a functional programming environment
which supports dependent types and analyzing LF data via pattern 
matching. It is a completely new implementation effort. Its
implementation of the logical framework LF in OCaml shares, adapts and 
extends some fundamental ideas from the Twelf system. The functional
programming environment which is built on top of the logical framework
LF is a completely new implementation based on previous theoretical
ideas presented in [Pientka:POPL08] and [PientkaDunfield:PPDP08].
