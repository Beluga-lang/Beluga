CRITICAL
========

*  12/1/08  :: Printing the result of unification
               i.e. printing terms with references denoting
               meta-variables (necessary to printing result of
               unification, and intermediate information in
               type reconstruction)

*  11/4/08  :: Unification: is the occurs check for parameter variables 
              necessary? -bp 

              Example: q[q[x,y],y] = x  should succeed
                       q[q[x,y],y] = y  should succeed

              q::A[x1:A,x2:B]  and x1,x2. x2/q

*  11/4/08  :: Unification: Instantiation of parameter variables
              Currently: Given 
             cPsi  |- s2' <= cPsi2   and 
             cPsi1 |- ss <= cPsi     and
             cPsi2 |- s' <= cPsi'    and [ss](s2' (s')) exists

              will (comp ss s2') s'  have the same result as comp ss (comp s2' s') ? 
                -bp
   
* 11/4/08  :: Testing of unification: Frontend should support
              processing of unification problems  -bp


* 10/23/08 :: Several cases of variable shadowing, might want to
              consider during code-walk.  -dwm


IMPORTANT
=========

* 11/4/08  :: Unification: Are cases for proj necessary? -bp

* 10/25/08 :: Make pretty printer break line late rather than early.
              -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: Fix pretty printing of internal syntax to show names
              rather than cids.  -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: Many invariants / comments written in different styles,
              making them harder to read.  Should revisit as group.
              -dwm

* 10/24/08 :: Add unify.mli.  -dwm

* 10/23/08 :: Investigate magic parens, i.e., Foo of (bar * baz)
              vs. Foo of bar * baz.  -dwm

* 10/22/08 :: Add target for debugging, add documentation on how to
              use.  -dwm

* 10/15/08 :: Cleanup Makefile.  -dwm

* 10/14/08 :: Consider a way to use labels to clean up pretty printer
              interface.  May be possible pass std_formatter and
              std_lvl in as default arguments.  -dwm


MINOR
=====

* 10/25/08 :: SigmaDec and SigmaDecl are a bit close together...  -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: Should probably make clo type abbreviations actual
              datatypes with constructors.  Clearer this way, esp. since we are
              currying functions.  -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: Functions that just tuple back up all of their arguments
              should maybe use f = function.  -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: Some functions named with ' and 1.  What's the
              difference / significance?  -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: Many of the longer pattern cases could probably be
              greatly simplified using pattern guards.  Investigate.
              -dwm

* 10/25/08 :: Could we call cD cDel to go better with cPsi?  -dwm

* 10/16/08 :: Add proper interface for token.ml.  Some tricky bits
              with the Camlp4 sig.  -dwm

* 10/15/08 :: Investigate gensym, think about wrap around.  -dwm

* 10/12/08 :: Fix documentation generation.  -dwm

* 10/12/08 :: Naming Scheme for Brigitte's code.  -bp
