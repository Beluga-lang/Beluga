Unification in type reconstruction encountered constraints because the given signature contains unification problems which fall outside the decideable pattern fragment.

Common causes are:

- there are meta-variables which are not only applied to a distinct set of bound variables 
- a meta-variable in the program depends on a context, but it must be in fact closed 

The constraint 
 
 abs (\x. M[ #S0[#S[..]], x]) =/= abs (\x. M[ #S0[#S[..]], x]) 

 was not solvable. 
 
 The program is considered ill-typed.
