improvements of Beluga.

cpm 
  The soundness proof takes a long time to coverage check.
  This may be due to the "naive" search we currently employ.

  Suggestion: Explore a better coverage strategy by for example
    using a better and more refined term depth calculation.

    At the moment, given a case expression
   with one pattern [a:tp] arr nat (arr (arr S U) a), Beluga will
   potentiall split the first argument up to depth 3, although only the
   second argument needs to be split up to depth 3.
   
eta.bel
   This little example illustrates that we currently do not support
   automatic eta-expansion when we pattern match on contextual objects.
   Eta-expansion is only supported on the LF level. 

recon.bel
   This little example illustrate that we currently do not support
   type reconstruction for type labels; hence, we require the user to
   write a type annotation
